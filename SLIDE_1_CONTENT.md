**What is App Builder?**
Adobe's framework for building secure, scalable cloud-native applications

**Core Value:**
With App Builder, you can build secure and scalable apps that extend Adobe Commerce native functionality as well as integrate with third-party solutions. Adobe takes care of provisioning and managing compute, storage, and CDN capacity so developers can just focus on building apps. Importantly, App Builder requires no customization to the core product code, which results in simplified upgrades and lower cost of ownership.

**Key Benefits:**

🔒 **Secure Execution**
- Isolated containers
- Enterprise authentication (Adobe IMS)
- Built-in credential management

⚡ **Auto-Scaling Compute**
- Adobe I/O Runtime (serverless)
- Handles 1 to 10,000+ requests
- Pay only for what you use

🌐 **Seamless Integration**
- Extends Adobe Commerce native functionality
- Third-party service connectivity
- Pre-built connectors

📦 **Managed Platform**
- No servers to provision
- Adobe manages compute, storage, CDN
- Simplified upgrades (no core customization)

🚀 **Rapid Deployment**
- One command: `aio app deploy`
- Development to production in seconds
- Built-in CI/CD support

## Speaking Notes for Slide 1

**Duration**: 30 seconds

**Script**:
"Before we jump into the demo, let me quickly introduce Adobe App Builder.

App Builder is Adobe's framework for building custom cloud-native applications that extend Adobe Experience Cloud - including Adobe Commerce.

What makes it powerful? With App Builder, you build secure and scalable apps that extend Adobe Commerce native functionality and integrate with third-party solutions. Adobe takes care of provisioning and managing compute, storage, and CDN capacity - so you just focus on building apps.

Importantly, App Builder requires no customization to core product code. This means simplified upgrades and lower cost of ownership.

Five key capabilities:
- Secure execution with isolated containers
- Auto-scaling compute - no capacity planning needed
- Seamless integration with Adobe and third-party services
- Fully managed platform - compute, storage, and CDN handled by Adobe
- Rapid deployment - from code to production in seconds

Today, we'll use App Builder to create an AI-powered documentation assistant. Let's see it in action."
